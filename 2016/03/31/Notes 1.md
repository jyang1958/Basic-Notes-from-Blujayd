## Watson

* Watson right now serves as a model as almost like a 3D Printer in which can be used to create 3D Models
* In the future, Watson can be used to create stuff potentially, like artificial limbs
* [Image Recognition](http://vision.alchemy.ai/?cm_mc_uid=62053925588014545522067&cm_mc_sid_50200000=1459387325) from watson (could be used to tie images to 3D models?)
  * The idea of image recognition can be translated into facial recognition which can also be used for plastic surgery or surgical facial procedures
  * However, facial recognition does not really work efficiently right now
  * ["How Face Recognition Works"](http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/gadgets/high-tech-gadgets/facial-recognition.htm)
  * 61.4 percent accuracy rate for facial recognition

* [Watson Researching](http://www.wired.com/insights/2015/02/what-can-watson-do-for-your-company/)
* Last July, MIT Technology Review reported that Watson is poised to overtake human doctors in oncology expertise. With some tweaking to its current knowledge base, Watson will soon be able to stay informed of all the cutting-edge research data and provide up-to-the-minute treatment recommendations, exceeding what even the most focused human doctor is able to provide.
*  a more engaging, personalized and relevant shopping experience
  * where you can use natural language to find clothes

## 3D Models
* Also for 3D Models, it is pretty much like a virtual 3D Printer which can later be used to print 3D items if need be
* Turning 2D images to 3D models, [Example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4aMQQv2Zvk&ebc=ANyPxKrxupzqXzE-hGcRvAHsePz07aESFj3HxrvLEDz46ooYDdWO5AvYvfC6am_N3WXicfoYFQcY) that is compatible with the ipad camera

## Brain Games/Mental Computer
The force is strong within you...
